# Medical Software Design 

This repository serves as the default collection for all resources associated
with the Duke BME Medical Software Design course (BME547).

Your can consult the [Syllabus](syllabus.md) for an overview of the course
content, and the course [Schedule](schedule.md) to see what the progression of
course topics will be over the semester.  All [Lecture](Lecture/) content is
also available for review, as are all of the [Assignments](Assignments/), which
will have due dates appears on the course Sakai site.  General
[Resources](Resources/) are also available to help with using various software
packages, setting up development tools, etc.

A generic python virtual environment can be created using the included
`requirements.txt` file, which should provide package coverage for all of the
examples and Jupyter notebooks in this repository.  

*All code has been written to be compatible with Python >=3.5; Python 2.7 usage
will require some tweaking, specifically the `print()` function calls and fancy
string formatting.*

A development version of this repository is here: https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mlp6/Medical-Software-Design

Dr. David Ward has continued to teach and innovate on this class beyond the Fall 2018 semester: https://github.com/dward2/BME547
